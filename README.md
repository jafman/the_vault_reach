# The vault (Reach)
A Vault program (written in reach language) that functions like a dead man’s switch. It should allow the Deployer to deposit some large amount of tokens. It should then ask the Deployer to press the switch. If the Deployer presses the button, the contract should return the funds to them. If the Deployer does not press the switch then it transfers the funds to the Attacher.

## Run
```
../reach run
```
